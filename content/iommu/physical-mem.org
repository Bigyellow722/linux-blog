#+title: Physical Memory Model
#+author: lhkwqy

Regardless of the selected memory model, there exists one-to-one mapping between the physical page frame number (PFN) and the corresponding struct page.

* ~FLATMEM~

This model is suitable for non-NUMA systems with contiguous, or mostly contiguous, physical memory.

There is global ~mem_map~ array that maps the entire physical memory.

To allocate the ~mem_map~ array, architecture specific setup code should call ~free_are_init~. The mappings array is not usable until the call to ~memblock_free_all~ that hands all the memory to the page allocator.
